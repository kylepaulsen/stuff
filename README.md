Well I guess it is public... OK fine you can look at it.

Just keep in mind that there might be random things in here. It could be anything. One day you might see a really ugly monster. Another you might see something as beautiful as the lost works of Pierre de Fermat (something about proofs and margins).

That being said... if you are here to see good work samples, **YOU ARE IN THE WRONG PLACE!**

So normally I would just put this stuff in my public Dropbox folder, but dropbox decided to stop rendering HTML in the public folder :rage1: So now I turn to github pages. Here is where it is rendered: http://www.kylepaulsen.com/stuff

Anyway yeah... this is my stuff.
