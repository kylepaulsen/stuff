        <h1>Password Leak Checker</h1>
        <p>This page will check with <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">https://haveibeenpwned.com</a>'s APIs to see if your password has been leaked. I encourage you to view this page's source (secondary click (right click) -> View page source) to verify that this page isn't doing anything weird with your password.</p>
        <p>The way this works is simple:
            <ol>
                <li>Gather password from input</li>
                <li>Hash password with SHA-1 to get a hex string</li>
                <li>Take the first 5 characters of that hex string and send it to https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{first 5 hash chars}</li>
                <li>That request sends back a list of all hashes that begin with the first 5 characters you sent</li>
                <li>Check client side if your hash is in the list</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Because of this, your full hashed password isn't sent anywhere. The first 5 characters aren't enough to figure out what your password is. Even if someone was able to get your returned list of hashes with your first 5 characters, they wouldn't even know if your full hash was found in the list.</p>
